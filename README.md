🍕 Maximizing Revenue and Efficiency in the Pizza Business 📈
As a restaurant owner, understanding the intricacies of your business's performance is key to driving growth and success. 🚀 Let's delve into the insights gleaned from our recent analysis:

📊 Sales by Revenue: With total revenue hitting $817K this year, we're on a steady growth trajectory. July saw our highest sales, while September and October lagged. Promotional runs like happy hours and referral programs could bolster sales during slower months.

🍕 Best and Worst Sellers: Identifying our top and bottom pizzas is a game-changer. By adjusting prices and promotions, we can boost revenue and cater to customer preferences more effectively.

📦 Orders: Analyzing average orders per day and pizzas per order allows for better inventory management, reducing waste and optimizing staffing levels. Fridays are bustling, while Sundays present opportunities for targeted promotions.

💰 Pricing Strategies: With an average pizza cost of $16, we're exploring dynamic pricing to capitalize on top sellers and stimulate demand for lesser-known options.

⏰ Peak Times: Our busiest periods—morning, afternoon, and evening peaks—call for heightened staffing and product availability to meet customer demand efficiently.

📈 Correlation Analysis: Identifying outliers in revenue and order data helps us understand anomalies, like extreme spending in November and August, allowing for targeted interventions.

🔍 Pareto Analysis: Pareto analysis reveals that 80% of sales come from just 21 pizzas. By focusing on menu optimization, pricing strategies, cross-selling, and feedback-driven iteration, we can maximize revenue and customer satisfaction.
